
In this Final Project, you have 2 options; you can choose the option of working on the pre-prepared questions that are a part of the Standard Final project (Option 1), or you can work on one of the provided five datasets and formulate your own data question and Dashboards in Tableau (Option 2). 

It's up to you! 

> #### Note  
> If you choose to work on your own project (Option 2) and you feel lost after working on it for an hour or so (you canâ€™t decide on a question based on the dataset, or are finding it difficult to get inspired), we recommend you to switch to the available Standard Final Project (Option 1) to finish the project on time.

### Option 1: Standard Final Project

You will be working with data from the Canadian Open Data portal. Specifically, you will work with the following datasets that are linked [in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B2pYgUBLMVEq3rkbcMenu4An_JboESJd?usp=sharing) for download access. The files in the folder are:

- Weekly earnings from 1.1.2001 to 15.4.2015 (weekly_earnings - CSV)
- Housing constructions from 1955 to 2019 (real_estate_numbers - CSV)
- House prices from 1.1.2005 to 1.9.2020 (real_estate_prices - EXCEL)
- Housing_price_index from November 1979 to September 2020
- Office_realestate_index from November 1979 to September 2020
- Consumer index from November 1979 to September 2020

#### Tasks:
Use Tableau to answer the following questions and deliver results using a 5-minute PowerPoint or PDF presentation. All questions should be answered using the right visualizations:

- Show the trend of house prices across Canada in the last 40 years (table housing_price_index).
- Compare the trend after 2005 with actual benchmark prices in table real_estate_prices to see if there are any differences.
- Compare this trend with the trend of office prices. Which one is getting more expensive, faster?
- Create a heatmap of Canada with current house prices for each available district.
- Are the price differences between different districts increasing?
- Compare the trend of house prices with earnings. *In case you want to plot monthly salary, be aware that the earnings value is per week.
- Did people spend more of their earnings in 2014 than they did in 2001?
- There were several economic crises in the world in the last 40 years, including these four: Black Monday (1987), Recession (early 1990s), dot com bubble (2000 - 2002), Financial crisis (2007 - 2009). Show the effect of these crises on:
  - Earnings
  - House prices
  - Office prices
  - House constructions
  - Consumer index
- Plot consumer_index together with housing_price_index and fit the regression line between them. Can we predict consumer_index from the housing_price_index?
- Try to find an interesting pattern, trend, outlier, etc. from the data used in the above questions.
  - HINT : Double check all units in the table before any comparison.
  
  
### Option 2: Creating on Your Own Question and Dashboard
If you decide to go with Option 2, [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A02_9D5_sbLyrjnaDDiOEUvDY5qzKGJt?usp=sharing) includes the 5 datasets you can choose from. They are also all linked below.
